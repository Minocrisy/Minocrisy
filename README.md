## üöÄ What I'm Building & Exploring

Here are some of the key projects and areas I'm currently focused on:

### üìß Temporary Email Service (The "Freebie" Tool)

My first publicly available tool, designed to enhance your online privacy and combat spam with instant, disposable email addresses.

-   **Live Demo/Landing Page:** [https://minocrisy.com/temp-email-tool](https://minocrisy.com/temp-email-tool) (Once deployed to Vercel)
-   **Get the Code:** [https://github.com/Minocrisy/temp-email-app](https://github.com/Minocrisy/temp-email-app)

### üß† Minocrisy LLM & Tools Repository

A centralized hub for all Minocrisy-specific Large Language Model (LLM) prompts, custom tools, integration patterns, and reusable code snippets. This is my personal knowledge base for AI development.

-   **Explore the Repo:** [https://github.com/Minocrisy/minocrisy-llm-tools](https://github.com/Minocrisy/minocrisy-llm-tools)
-   **Wishlist of Future Ideas:** See what's next on the [WISHLIST.md](https://github.com/Minocrisy/minocrisy-llm-tools/blob/main/WISHLIST.md)

### üì± PrivyMail (Future Project)

An upcoming mobile/web application expanding on the temporary email concept, aiming for a more comprehensive and user-friendly experience. Stay tuned for updates!
